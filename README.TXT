Project: number-display
Authors: Michael Kölling and David J. Barnes

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

It is discussed in chapter 3.

To use this project, create an instance of class NumberDisplay. Then inspect this 
instance and leave the inspector window open. With the inspector window open, 
call the object's methods, such as increment and setValue.
 



//////////////////AWNSERS TO QUESTIONS///////////////////////


1: Class diagrams are shown 
as blueprints of classes and their relationships
while object diagrams are shown as little pictures of the object on the object bench.
Class diagrams focus on the structure of classes such as attributes or methods
 while object diagrams focus on object values.For example LabClass has a method that it can call named
enrollStudent (class diagram) and lab1 enrolls student1, student2, student3 (object diagram)



2: In real life applications, a class diagram can change when
developers discover better alternatives to their code,when fixing bugs during 
testing, or when stakeholders communicate with developers ordering
them to modify their structure to their liking.



3: An object diagram can change after we run our system,they can be destroyed
or modified.Same as class diagrams,when debugging we can see them change and when
modifying code.
